Multiple-Source-Separation
==========================

The objective of this project is to separate out the different sources of a convoluted signal at the output of the microphone array.

Multisource Separation is the term used to describe the algorithms or devices whose purpose it is to identify and differentiate between different signals simultaneously without having any prior information about any of the sources. Potential applications include the music industry, where the composition of a song can be predicted, beefing up security systems capturing any suspicious sounds and locating the source, and Digital Ears rendering hearing capabilities to machines. This project aims at the development of a robust multisource separation system.

Engineers and researchers in various disciplines have shown considerable interest in the problem of multisource separation. Among these are engineers working on signal processing problems such as developing gadgets for filtering out various instrumentals being played out in a song. With increased threat perceptions around the world, this system can act as a robust security tool with its ability to discern what was the content spoken by some particular individual of interest. However, the most important use of source separation is likely to be in the design of Human Computer Interfaces(HCI), speech recognition systems in particular with an ability to distinguish between the owner`s voice and unknown voice from a distance. This can enable us to create systems for tactile HCIs, which can recognize their commander. 

The increased interest in the field is also in part due to rapid advances in hardware technology that allow sophisticated signal processing algorithms to be implemented in real time. With the availability of enormous computation power on a small chip in form of Digital Signal Processors (DSP), it is now possible to implement these systems even on a mobile unit for a variety of applications. This interest is likely to continue as multisource separation systems find more and more practical applications.

From a more personal perspective, the original idea came from a desire to separate out the voice of a particular person from the sound comprising of noise and voice of several other persons.
